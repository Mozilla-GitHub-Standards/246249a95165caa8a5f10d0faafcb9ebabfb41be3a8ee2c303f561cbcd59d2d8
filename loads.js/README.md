# Loads.js

A library to send data to the [loads](http://loads.rtfd.org) runner.  This
library doesn't do the integration with the test frameworks you want to use.
Rather, it provides a high level interface you can work with.

If you are looking for an integration with mocha, for instance, have a look
[here](https://github.com/mozilla-services/loads.js/mocha-loads).

## Installation

You can install loads.js with npm. Go in your project and run

```
$ npm install ../../services/loads.js
```
